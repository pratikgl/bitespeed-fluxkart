## Overview

This would provide a way to identify and keep track of a customer's identity across multiple purchases.

It would link different orders made with different contact information to the same person.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pratikgl/bitespeed-fluxkart.git
cd bitespeed-fluxkart
```

## Setup

1. open the `pkg/config/app.go` file and replace the following values with your own

```go
const (
	DBUserName = "your_username"
	DBPassword = "your_password"
	DBName     = "your_db_name"
)
```

2. Create a database with the name you provided in the previous step

3. Run the following command to start the server

  "contact":{
    "primaryContatctId": number,
    "emails": string[], // first element being email of primary contact
    "phoneNumbers": string[], // first element being phoneNumber of primary contact
